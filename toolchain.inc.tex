The toolchain being used to tag the corpora was a combination of tools comprising the tag wizard of the Wmatrix system\footnote{\url{http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/wmatrix/}}.  
This consists of a number of tagging and analysis tools, each communicating using intermediate files and managed using a series of shell scripts.  
The tag wizard shares a lot of commonalities with standard NLP processing pipelines as it consists of two annotation systems (CLAWS and USAS) plus a frequency profiling and keyness comparison step.
