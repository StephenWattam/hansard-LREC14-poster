    \item When moving processing to a high performance cluster there are two main gains:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Parallelism, which greatly benefits this problem as it is 'embarrassingly parallel'
            \item Serial speed of each compute node (clusters are usually well specified w.r.t. RAM and CPU provisions)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-HEC}
Throughput for toolchain on a typical current system, say, an i5.  \todo{Run on my machine}


\subsection{HEC}
Times from the summary script\todo{median would be better; density plot of the below; plot vs. filesizes should be ~linear}.

Jobs were complete in 3 days.

"Each task runs all files in 20 directories through the tagger.  The other times are per-task could time info, just to give an idea of the variance.
The minimum is probably flawed because the list of directories was padded to be divisible by 20."

    \item Throughput on HEC
    \item Scalability of HEC setup
