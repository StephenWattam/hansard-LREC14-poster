\begin{itemize}
    \item When moving processing to a high performance cluster there are two main gains:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Parallelism, which greatly benefits this problem as it is 'embarrassingly parallel'
            \item Serial speed of each compute node (clusters are usually well specified w.r.t. RAM and CPU provisions)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-HEC}
Throughput for toolchain on a typical current system, say, an i5.  \todo{Run on my machine}


\subsection{HEC}
Times from the summary script\todo{median would be better; density plot of the below; plot vs. filesizes should be ~linear}.

\begin{verbatim}
Total time (s): 24428748    ( / 60 / 60 / 24 = 282 days on the HPC )
Mean (s): 10955             ( / 60 / 60 = 3.04 hours )
Min (s): 223                ( / 60 = 3.7 minutes )
Max (s): 98872              ( / 60 / 60 = 27 hours )

    \item Throughput on HEC
    \item Scalability of HEC setup
